### **Army Records Information Management System**
- Military affairs are chaotic. Statistics, occurrences, and the 
organization of materials and equipment are difficult to manage. 
Battlefield commanders require the ability to view large amounts of 
information simplistically, particularly as ongoing situations 
become more complex and more units, personnel, and equipment 
enter the battle space. The Army requires that battle space material 
logistics be displayed by hierarchy. This system is designed to 
connect with a large database of personnel, equipment items, 
vehicles, and consumables. These entities are organized by military 
hierarchal structure which can be traversed at a glance, giving 
commanders a visual summary.
